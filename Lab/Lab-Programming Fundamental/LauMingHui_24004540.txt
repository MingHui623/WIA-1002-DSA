My name is Lau Ming Hui with matrix number, 24004540. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this program. This is because the course is quite challenging as mention by previous session seniors.

I acquired A- for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will practice as much as possible. Wish me luck!!!Tuesday, 18 March 2025Tuesday, 18 March 2025
